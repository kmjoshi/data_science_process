### Randomized search for data science tips
#
My notes on Andrew Ng courses:  
[Machine Learning](ml.md)  
[Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Hyperparameter Tuning](deep_learning_tuning.md)  
[Structuring ML Projects](ml_projects.md)  
[Convolutional Neural Networks](cnn.md)  
[Sequence Models](sequences.md)
#
Quick EDA via:  
[pandas-profiling](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JosPolfliet/pandas-profiling/blob/master/examples/meteorites.ipynb): creates an automated report of all variables in a dataframe  
#
Dashboards:  
[metabase](https://www.metabase.com/): very good! connects to most databases, has auth, embeddable dashboards, native querying  
[grafana](https://grafana.com/): for timeseries data  
[Apache Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/index.html): no mongo support  
#
ETL:  
[OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Documentation-For-Users): Great tool for preprocessing/cleaning datasets with text fields
#
Viz:
