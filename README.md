My notes on Andrew Ng courses:  
[Machine Learning](ml.md)  
[Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Hyperparameter Tuning](deep_learning_tuning.md)  
[Structuring ML Projects](ml_projects.md)  
[Convolutional Neural Networks](cnn.md)
[Sequence Models](sequences.md)
#
Quick EDA via:  
[pandas-profiling](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JosPolfliet/pandas-profiling/blob/master/examples/meteorites.ipynb): creates an automated report of all variables in a dataframe  
[Apache Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/index.html): configurable dashboard for DBs with many chart types
#
ETL:  
[OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Documentation-For-Users): Great tool for preprocessing/cleaning datasets with text fields
