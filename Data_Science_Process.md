An effort to better define my Data Science process

<!-- # Pitch
Hi! I am Keshav Joshi, lover of all things, free-thinking, generally nice person, GaTech Alum, holder of two Masters Degrees (Physics/CS) and am looking for Data Science work of all kinds (full-time/part-time/contract).

This [link]() outlines my view of the Data Science process, with examples of work I have done with each.

Non-technical Data Science Process:
- Do you have data?
	- Yes!
		- Do you want a [post-hoc](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/129992/what-is-the-problem-with-post-hoc-testing) analysis of factors? Not advised! Design research questions first! (cite)
		- Do you want descriptive analysis of existing processes! Done let's hook it up to Tableau/any other dashboard tool!
	- No :/
		- Design research questions!
		- Design surveys/data input streams that would help answer those questions!
- Where's the ML/AI?
	- Do you need ML/AI?
		- Are the standard industry practices for answering those questions not sufficient?
		- Is this a repeated process with mostly objective answers?
			- Yes! Perfect for implementing AI
	- What can you do with ML?
		- Video: [Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/rv1fW/what-machine-learning-can-and-cannot-do), [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/9n83j/more-examples-of-what-machine-learning-can-and-cannot-do). can audit this course to access
		- https://brohrer.github.io/five_questions_data_science_answers.html
		- Segment data into clusters that might/might not be human-identifiable
		- Predict the ```FUTURE!```
	- Can I use classical AI techniques or control theory?
		- Is this a Constraint-satisfaction problem?
		- Is this an optimization problem?

Issues with the Data Science Process that I cannot handle but would like to learn!
- Putting a model into production and concurrently serving many customers
- Retraining a model with streaming/batch data. ```model drift```: when a model optimizes for new data and loses accuracy on original data set
	- Versioning?
